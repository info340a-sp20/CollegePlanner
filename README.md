# Project 2

This repository contains code for an interactive web app, created for the _Client-Side Web Development_ course at the UW iSchool.

**Navigation bars** 

*Managers* : There are three managers in this app. Lecture manager, Assignment manager, and Quizzes/Exams manger. You can click and go into each manager and add tasks for each category. You can add to each days(Monday~Sunday) and you can delete every tasks when the new week comes! Also, use the search button to find task easily (ex. search only the class you want to view!)

*home* : There is one home nagivation, which navigates you to the main page of the app. It integrates all manager's tasks and show all tasks for that week. There are two view avaible for home page, which is calander view and memo view. Only Memo view is used in mobile version and calander view is not because of the visibility. 

The logging in function will be implemented for the final firebase app! Thank you
